# Flight emissions data

A distributed project to collate flight data for emissions calculations.

## How to contribute?

If you'd like to take on responsibility for recording data for a specific airport, you will need to:

1. save daily JSON files of flights
2. create a metadata JSON file that describes your airport dataset
3. update the [Primary index file](index.json) to include your airport

See [our examples](examples/) for more information

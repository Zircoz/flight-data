# flight-data
A distributed project to collate flight data for emissions calculations.

## How to contribute?

If you'd like to take on responsibility for recording data for a specific airport, you will need to:

* save daily JSON files of flights (format to be defined)
* create an index JSON file that describes your dataset (format to be defined)
* update the [index.json file](data/index.json) to include your airport

# Flight emissions data

A distributed project to collate flight data for emissions calculations.

## How to contribute?

If you'd like to take on responsibility for recording data for a specific airport, you will need to:

1. save daily JSON files of flights (format to be defined)
2. create an metadata JSON file that describes your dataset
3. update the [index.json file](index.json) to include your airport

See [our examples](examples/) for more information

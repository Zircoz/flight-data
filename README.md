# Flight emissions data

We started collating flight emissions data for Leeds and Bradford airport to power our [Flight Emissions comparison tool](https://odileeds.org/projects/flight-emissions/). We realised that it would benefit others if the emissions data were openly available and if other people could contribute by doing the work for other airports. This project aims to allow different people/organisations to take responsibility for collating data for different airports and publish it to their own URLs but make it available to others so we can see the bigger picture of flight emissions.

## How to contribute?

If you'd like to take on responsibility for recording data for a specific airport, you will need to:

1. save [daily JSON files of flights](examples/#flight-data)
2. create a [metadata JSON file](examples/#airport-metadata) that describes your airport dataset
3. update the [Primary index file](examples/#primary-index) to include your airport

See [our examples](examples/) for more information
